# VaalikoneMarkov

Simple practice project I'm coding to teach myself java.

This project uses open data from avoindata.fi and uses answers from voting aid application to generate new, Markov chain generated answers.

This is WIP and still at its start, planned features:

- Improved grammar
- GUI
- Twitter implementation
